                designing was interesting. Back then when youtube was not full
                of those content creators, the only way to learn is from web and
                photoshop docs itself. Remember bookmarking a blog? Pepperidge

                    Sounds trivial. But I really am learning a lot by making a

                    implementation. How to handle the program flow, the

                    relational object from different thread, deadlock problem
                    solving, and many more. The most important of this is the
                    convertability of this skills to be transfered to other
                    field such making game or even requesting data from API.
