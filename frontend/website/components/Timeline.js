                Old day used to be full with facebook games (Car Town, Social City, etc.). Somehow I found out that
                designing was interesting. Back then when youtube was not full of those content creators, the only way
                to learn is from web and Photoshop docs itself. Remember bookmarking a blog? Pepperidge farm remembers.
